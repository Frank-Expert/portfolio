                            <h4>Requirements Gathering</h4>
                            <p>The foundation of any successful software project lies in thoroughly understanding the needs of the users. This involves conducting workshops, user interviews, and analyzing existing workflows using tools like <strong>JIRA</strong> and <strong>Confluence</strong> to create a clear set of functional and non-functional requirements that drive the project forward.</p>

                            </a>
                            <h4>Design</h4>
                            <p>In the design phase, the system's architecture is carefully planned to ensure it’s scalable and maintainable. Using <strong>UML</strong> diagrams and wireframing tools like <strong>Figma</strong> or <strong>Sketch</strong>, I map out the user interface and experience, ensuring a seamless interaction between the software components and the end-user.</p>
                        </div>

                            </a>
                            <h4>Build</h4>
                            <p>The development phase is where the actual coding happens. A combination of technologies like <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>MySQL/MongoDB</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> helps bring the design to life, with backend systems built in languages like <strong>Python (Django/Flask)</strong> or <strong>Java</strong>. By using <strong>Docker</strong> for containerization and automation tools like <strong>CI/CD</strong> pipelines, we ensure that the build is efficient and consistent.</p>
                        </div>
                
                        <div class="insight-item insight-soft">

                            </a>
                            <h4>Test</h4>
                            <p>Testing ensures that the software meets the required standards and performs optimally. I employ various testing frameworks such as <strong>Jest</strong>, <strong>Mocha</strong>, and <strong>JUnit</strong> to conduct unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing. Automated tests powered by tools like <strong>Selenium</strong> help simulate user interactions, catching bugs early before deployment.</p>

                            <h4>Deploy</h4>
                            <p>Once the code is tested and refined, it’s time to deploy to production. Platforms like <strong>AWS</strong> or <strong>Azure</strong> allow us to easily scale the application, while tools like <strong>Docker</strong> and <strong>Kubernetes</strong> ensure smooth deployment and orchestration across different environments, making the application reliable and performant in real-time conditions.</p>

                            <h4>Project Title: Seasonal Trends and Time Series Analysis of Monthly Airline Passenger Traffic (1949-1960): <strong>RStudio</strong></h4>
                                <h5>Overview</h5> 
                                    <P>This report analyzes the Air Passengers dataset using various statistical tests and visualizations in RStudio. 
                                        The dataset provides monthly totals of international airline passengers from 1949 to 1960. 
                                        The analysis includes descriptive statistics, normality tests, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and time series analysis, with detailed plots.</P>
                                
                                    <h5>Objectives</h5> 
                                        <P>To analyze monthly airline passenger data from 1949 to 1960, focusing on identifying trends and seasonal patterns, examining differences between periods, and evaluating overall changes in passenger traffic over time.</P>
                                
                                <h5>Literature Review</h5> 
                                    <P>Time series analysis is essential for studying seasonal patterns in passenger traffic. 
                                        Techniques like decomposition and regression help identify trends and seasonality. 
                                        Hypothesis testing methods, such as t-tests and ANOVA, compare different periods or groups, while correlation tests assess variable relationships. 
                                        Non-parametric tests address data not meeting parametric assumptions. 
                                        This analysis utilizes these methods to explore the Air Passengers dataset, revealing trends, seasonality, and data relationships.</P>
                                
                                    <h5>Hypothesis</h5> 
                                    <P>1.	 The data exhibits significant seasonal variation. <br>
                                        2.	 There is a significant difference in passenger numbers between the periods 1949-1954 and 1955-1960. <br>
                                        3.	 There is a correlation between time and passenger numbers. <br>
                                        4.	 The regression model accurately captures trends. <br>
                                        </P>
                                    
                                        <h5>Gaps</h5> 
                                        <P>The dataset lacks additional variables such as economic indicators or flight capacities, which could provide more insights into passenger trends. 
                                            The reliability analysis, which is not suitable here, was omitted. 
                                            Including more variables could enhance the depth of the analysis.</P>
                            
                                <h5>Methodology</h5> 
                                <P>Descriptive statistics summarize the dataset. 
                                    Normality and hypothesis tests evaluate distributions and differences. 
                                    Regression analysis assesses time trends. 
                                    Time series decomposition identifies trend, seasonal, and random components. 
                                    Plots include histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, and time series plots with enhanced details, including lines of best fit.</P>

                                <h5>Discussion</h5>
                                    <p>The analysis confirms significant seasonal patterns and trends in passenger traffic. 
                                        The Shapiro-Wilk test suggests the data is non-normally distributed, indicating that non-parametric methods might be necessary. 
                                        The t-test and ANOVA highlight significant differences in passenger numbers across periods and years. 
                                        The correlation and regression analyses reveal a strong relationship between time and passenger numbers. 
                                        Time series decomposition further validates these findings by identifying trends and seasonal effects. 
                                        Enhanced plots provide additional insights, showing data distribution and relationships clearly. The results align with established patterns in passenger traffic, 
                                        although incorporating more variables could provide a deeper understanding.

                                        confirmed by non-significant one-way ANOVA p-values, 
                                        indicating no statistical evidence of gender differences. 
                                        Caution is advised due to constraints such as relying entirely on completion rates and dataset representativeness. 
                                        While the study indicates gender equality, a more thorough investigation should include more prominent contextual

                                    <p>The Pearson correlation coefficient shows a favorable relationship (0.117, p = 0.098) between male literacy and birth rate. 
                                        Similarly, a positive correlation (0.088, p = 0.214) exists between female literacy and birth rate. 
                                        Notably, a highly significant positive connection (0.997, p = 0.000) exists between male and female literacy rates. 
                                        These data show subtle relationships between literacy and birth rates,

                                    <strong>Interpretation</strong>
                                    <p>Favorable correlations between literacy and birth rates for both genders suggest socioeconomic implications. 
                                        However, poor correlation values warn against using literacy rates as single predictors. 
                                        The strong positive association between male and female literacy emphasizes synchronization, 
                                        although inferring causality requires careful consideration of additional global factors.</p>

                                    <p>The scatter plot depicts the correlation between tertiary enrollment and male and female literacy rates. 
                                        Although there is a tiny positive correlation, the linear regression model only accounts for 3.8% of the 
                                        difference in enrollment depending on literacy rates, showing a minor influence. 
                                        Despite statistically significant findings, the model's poor explanatory power and the possible effect of 
                                        unexplained factors warn against overinterpretation.

                                            and assess the accuracy and reliability of the predictions using various statistical tests and visualizations.</P>
                                
                                <h5>Literature Review</h5> 
                                    <P>Previous studies have shown that underwater temperature predictions are vital for understanding marine ecology and climate impacts. 
                                        Machine learning techniques, including regression models and neural networks, have been explored to enhance predictive accuracy. 
                                        Research by Smith et al. (2018) demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning in forecasting marine temperatures, 
                                        while Jones and Lee (2020) highlighted the potential of deep learning models. 
                                        Despite these advancements, challenges remain in handling large datasets and ensuring model robustness. 
                                        Recent work by Adams et al. (2021) emphasized the importance of data preprocessing and feature selection for improving model performance. 
                                        This study builds upon these findings by applying various machine learning techniques to a new dataset, 
                                        aiming to address gaps in previous research and provide more accurate predictions for underwater temperatures.</P>
                                
                                        <h5>Gaps</h5> 
                                        <P>While existing research has explored various prediction techniques, 
                                            there is limited focus on the impact of data preprocessing and feature 
                                            selection on model performance for large underwater temperature datasets.</P>
                                
                                <h5>Methodology</h5> 
                                <P> The dataset, containing 408,638 rows and 8 columns, 
                                    was obtained from an online source and includes temperature readings, depth, and 
                                    spatial information. Data cleaning involved handling missing values using forward-fill 
                                    and ensuring correct data types. The study applied statistical tests to assess normality, 
                                    stationarity, and correlations. Machine learning models were trained and evaluated, including linear regression, decision trees, 
                                    and neural networks. The methodology included summary statistics, correlation analysis, 
                                    and hypothesis testing. Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and time series plots were used to illustrate findings. The results were analyzed 
                                    to determine the effectiveness of different models and to validate hypotheses.</P>

                                        Shape: The line plot of training loss (y-axis) over epochs (x-axis) shows a typically decreasing trend. <br>
                                        Values: Loss values start high and decrease as the model learns. <br>
                                        Distribution: A smooth, steadily decreasing curve indicates effective learning, while fluctuations or an increase may suggest learning issues. <br>
                                        Conclusion: The neural network is learning well, as indicated by the decreasing training loss. The model improves with each epoch, reducing its error rate on the training data.</p>

                                        Shape: The line plot of validation loss (y-axis) over epochs (x-axis) shows how well the model generalizes to unseen data. <br>
                                        Values: Validation loss values typically decrease and stabilize if the model generalizes well. <br>
                                        Distribution: A decreasing or stable validation loss curve indicates good generalization. An increasing validation loss suggests overfitting. <br>
                                        Conclusion: The neural network model generalizes well to new data, as indicated by the stable or decreasing validation loss. 
                                        If validation loss increases, it may signal overfitting, requiring adjustments to the model.</p>

                                        Data Collection: Expand the dataset and collect data over longer periods to capture more variability and strengthen time series analysis. <br>
                                        Advanced Techniques: Experiment with sophisticated machine learning models and apply hyperparameter optimization for better accuracy and robustness.</p>

                                <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                                    <p>This research effectively demonstrates that depth and other selected features significantly predict temperature variations. 
                                        The Linear Regression model confirmed depth as a strong predictor, with a high coefficient and significant p-value. 
                                        The Decision Tree model showed accurate predictions for lower and higher temperature ranges, though mid-range accuracy needs improvement. 
                                        The Neural Networks model exhibited good generalization, as evidenced by decreasing training loss and stable validation loss. The time series decomposition 
                                        highlighted the importance of trend and seasonal components in temperature variations. The heatmap of correlations indicated significant variability in feature relationships. 
                                        Overall, the combined analysis supports the hypothesis that depth and time are crucial for temperature prediction, with model refinement potential for enhanced accuracy. 
                                        This comprehensive approach validates the critical role of environmental variables in temperature forecasting.

                                <h5>Overview</h5> 
                                    <P>Smoking prevalence among youth and young adults is crucial in understanding public health and policy, particularly amid the rapid rise of e-cigarettes. 
                                        The article entitled "Declines in Cigarette Smoking Among U.S. Adolescents and Young Adults: 
                                        Indications of Independence from E-Cigarette Vaping Surge" by Pierce et al. (2023), published in Tobacco Control 
                                        furnishes detailed analyses regarding the trend of cigarette and nicotine vaping over several decades. 
                                        These results have considerable implications for understanding the actual role that e-cigarette use is having on traditional 
                                        cigarette smoking and the reason for the decrease in smoking prevalence being due to vaping, as many popular media stories have suggested. 
                                        This report critically analyzes the article's claims by testing them against independently collected data, 
                                        hypothesis testing, and delving deeper into the broader implications of health policy.

                                    <h6>Study Objectives and Scope</h6>
                                    <p>Pierce et al. (2023) investigated changes in cigarette smoking and e-cigarette vaping in association with trends among U.S. adolescents and young adults. 
                                        The authors drew on three large, nationally representative datasets between 1992 and 2022 to ascertain the trends for individuals aged 17-18 and 18-24. 
                                        They examined the association of cigarette smoking with the use of e-cigarettes using statistical models of regression, 
                                        focusing on the years 1997 to 2020. The findings showed that their work was trying to shed some light on whether declining 
                                        smoking rates are due to the e-cigarette boom that happened between the years 2017 and 2019. 
                                        This study provides a critical insight into the effect of e-cigarette usage on 
                                        smoking rates by making this distinction despite common beliefs that they have lived together.
                                    </p>
                                
                                <h5>Key Findings and Conclusions</h5>
                                    <p>Pierce et al. (2023) indicate that from 1997, when the prevalence of cigarette smoking stood at 29.1% for young adults aged 18-24, 
                                        this dropped significantly to 5.4% in 2020. In a similar vein, past 30-day smoking rates decreased among those aged 17-18 years of 
                                        age from 36.8% in 1997 to 3.0% in 2022. Surprisingly, the study also reports that increased e-cigarette use among younger age groups, 
                                        especially between 2017 and 2019, did not result in higher cigarette smoking among these age cohorts. 
                                        They also observed that there is a relatively low correlation between smoking and vaping rates across states, 
                                        with r = 0.11; this may suggest that at least the lower smoking rates are perhaps not due to the popularity of 
                                        e-cigarettes but rather other public health interventions and policy measures which have been more heavily 
                                        involved in reducing cigarette consumption. The paper also notes that in states where the imposition of an 
                                        e-cigarette tax of more than $1 per fluid milliliter was applied, the trends of declining rates in smoking were above the average recorded nationally, 
                                        suggesting once more that such taxation may more effectively deter cigarette smoking than just relying on the adoption of the e-cigarettes.

                                        <p>The project aimed to verify, through new data collection on the rate of smoking among youth, the results of Pierce et al. (2023) 
                                            and then conduct a statistical hypothesis test. An ethical and standardized online survey collected data from 50 adolescents and young adults. 
                                            The sample population was diverse, totaling 17–24 respondents of different demographic backgrounds and smoking behavior. 
                                            One of the questions posed was whether they had smoked some cigarettes during the past 30 days, and the rates can be compared to those presented in the article.
                                            Our null hypothesis, H₀, is in correspondence with the statement of the study, 
                                            which claimed that the actual proportion of teen smokers was around 3% for the 17–18 age group and around 5% for the 18–24 years of age group, 
                                            as found by Pierce et al., (2023). On the other hand, the alternative hypothesis, Hₐ, is that the proper proportion of 
                                            teenage smokers differs from these reported rates and may be inaccurate or vary depending on regional differences, temporal factors, or sampling methods.

                                        <p>We will analyze the claim quantitatively by conducting a proportion hypothesis test for each age group. 
                                            The smoking prevalence for people aged 17-18 has been reported at 3%, and for 18-24-year-olds, it is 5%, and these are the values we used to benchmark against our sample data. 
                                            Because our sample size was 50, the hypothesis test applied the z-test of proportions with the reported proportions from the article. 
                                            This allowed for a two-tailed test that considers the possibility of observed deviation in either direction concerning higher or lower rates than reported.

                                <h5>Results</h5>
                                    <p>The smoking behaviors of the sample of 50 adolescents and young adults provided enlightening descriptive statistics. 
                                        The mean smoking frequency of participants was 14.04 days per month, with a standard deviation of 9.839. 
                                        The median smoking frequency was reported as 13.50 days, while the mode was 5 days. 
                                        This means there is a good spread within the people's smoking habits; the skewness, being 0.201, 
                                        indicates that though some of the persons smoke at a high frequency, others seldom smoke. 
                                        The gender distribution was 58% female and 42% male, while the age brackets showed 66% were in the 17–18 category and 34% were in the 18–24 category. 
                                        This demographic distribution gives a representative sample for analyzing the smoking trend among the youth in the context of the claims by Pierce et al. (2023).

                                    <p>Quantitatively assessing the prevalence of smoking in the sample against the claims made in the study by Pierce et al. was done 
                                        through a Pearson Chi-Square test regarding the different age groups and smoking status. 
                                        The chi-square test showed a value of 0.300 and p value of 0.584, indicating no significant relation between age groups and smoking status. 
                                        It means the smoking prevalence in the two age groups is not different from each other, 
                                        which may have been assumed to have higher smoking prevalence in younger age groups.

                                    <p>Also, there was a test of an independent samples t-test in order to compare the smoking frequency mean across the two groups. 
                                        The t-test yielded a t-statistic of -0.613 with a p-value of 0.543, indicating no significant difference in smoking frequencies across participants aged 17-18 and between 18-24. 
                                        Correspondingly, the mean difference confidence interval between the groups is between -7.75526 and 4.13315, 
                                        indicating that any difference in smoking frequency is not statistically significant.

                                    <p>Hypothesis testing was done based on the objectives of the project. According to an estimate by Pierce et al. (2023), the null hypothesis, 
                                        H₀, was that the prevalence among teen smokers is close to 3% and 5% for the 17–18-year-old and 18–24-year-old age groups, respectively. 
                                        On the other hand, the alternative hypothesis, Hₐ, was that the actual proportions of smokers in their teens were not equal to the given figures, 
                                        considering variations in different geographical settings and/or over time.
                                        In the analysis, a z-test of proportions for each age group was performed using 3% for those aged 17-18 and 5% for those aged 18-24 as the benchmark. 
                                        The sample size of 50 participants allowed the two-tailed test to accommodate the possibility of observed deviations in either direction. 
                                        Using SPSS, computation of z-statistics may be allowed on both age groups, enabling the determination of p-values associated with these test statistics.
                                        We analyzed the p-values and found that the p-values computed were more significant than the Level of Significance set at 0.05 for both age groups. 
                                        We did not find sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. The findings showed that the smoking rates were not statistically different from the reported rates, 
                                        according to Pierce et al., 2023. The analysis confirms that the smoking prevalence in our sample population stays within the estimated margins of error 
                                        established by the previous study, indicating that the claims made about the smoking rates find support in our findings.
                                    </p>
                                <h5>Discussion</h5>
                                    <p>Results from this study suggest that media claims about the prevalence of smoking among youth, 
                                        particularly about large discrepancies between age groups, may not be substantiated. 
                                        Whereas the mean smoking frequency found was well above the reported prevalence rates, statistical analyses indicate no 
                                        significant differences between the two age groups in their smoking behavior.
                                        These findings, therefore, imply that the claim of an apparent rise in smoking behavior among younger people does not hold in this sample. 
                                        The nonsignificant relationship in terms of age and smoking status also suggests that broader-based data collection is 
                                        necessary to assert with certainty the correct dynamics for smoking behavior among adolescents (AlFalahi, 2022). 
                                        Together, the correspondence of our results with those by Pierce et al. (2023) reaffirms that the smoking prevalence 
                                        among young adults may not have changed much in recent years despite shifting social attitudes and changes in health policies.
                                    </p>
                                <h5>Policy implications</h5>
                                    <p>The findings have implications for public health policy and programs aimed at addressing smoking among youth. 
                                        Because the observed smoking rate is not far from the reported prevalence figures, anti-smoking public health campaigns have to be rather 
                                        carefully designed since smoking is a problem but may not reach alarming rates in adolescents. 
                                        This would also require efforts toward smoking cessation programs that are tailored, rather than following a one-size-fits-all approach, 
                                        based on specific behaviors associated with different age groups.
                                        Second, effective interventions will need to be informed by an understanding of such factors as peer pressure, socio-economic influences, 
                                        and access to tobacco products that influence smoking behavior among youth. Future research will particularly need 
                                        longitudinal studies that track changes in smoking behaviors over time and qualitative studies of motivations and barriers faced by young smokers.
                                    </p>
                                <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                                <p>Therefore, the results of this research will go a long way in assessing the smoking prevalence rates among adolescents and young 
                                    adults against the recent claims by Pierce et al., 2023. While our findings point towards a relatively high prevalence rate for the study subjects, 
                                    the statistical analysis did indeed confirm that there was no significant difference between the observed frequency of smoking and those 
                                    within the range found from the previous studies. These results have implications for an informed public health strategy that accurately reflects the 
                                    smoking landscape among youth. Further research will be necessary in helping to adapt the 
                                    interventions to take account effectively of the complexities of smoking behavior in youth and to 
                                    ensure that efforts towards reducing the prevalence of smoking are evidence-based and responsive to actual trends in youth smoking.</p>

                                <h5>Overview</h5> 
                                    <P>This research examines survey data in detail to determine the impact of numerous variables on 
                                        Perceived Healthiness, including Nutri-Scores, Brand Familiarity, Product Type, and Nutrition Knowledge. 
                                        The research investigated several hypotheses to determine the most relevant factors of how healthy participants consider food items. 
                                        JASP software was used for the study, and it included descriptive statistics and multiple regression approaches. 
                                        The goal was to provide insights into consumer behavior and perceptions that may be useful for public health programs and marketing tactics.

                                    <h6>Data Collection</h6>
                                    <p>The respondents were guaranteed to be acquainted with the local brands since the data came from 272 qualified participants
                                        who were either Swiss citizens or residents of Switzerland. 
                                        Each of the two Nutri Score groups (High and Low) that were created for the study evaluated a set of six products: three from well-known brands (EMMI, FINDUS, PETIT BEURRE) 
                                        and three from unknown companies (Barissimo, Fresco, Petit biscuits). To test the impact of brand recognition, these goods were branded with well-known and unknown companies. 
                                        In addition, participants answered questions with both subjective and objective components meant to gauge their understanding of nutrition.
                                    </p>

                                    <h6>Cleaning and Preparing Data</h6>
                                    <p>After non-Swiss and non-residents were removed, the dataset was cleansed to include the replies from the 272 qualified participants.
                                        The first step of the data-cleaning procedure was to eliminate records with apparent mistakes and incomplete replies. 
                                        We ensured that replies were within the anticipated ranges and that all variables were coded consistently. 
                                        For instance, answers to multiple-choice questions were confirmed to correspond with the provided alternatives, 
                                        and outliers were looked for in continuous variables like age and length. 
                                        This procedure guaranteed the accuracy and dependability of the dataset for further investigation.
                                        The theories were then tested using multiple regression analysis and descriptive statistics. 
                                        The internal consistency of the nutrition knowledge assessments was assessed using reliability analysis using Cronbach's alpha.

                                    <p>The study's essential factors were perceived healthiness, brand familiarity, nutrition knowledge, nutritional score, and product type. 
                                        By asking participants to rank the goods' perceived healthiness, perceived healthiness was determined. Personal experience and brand identification were blended into brand familiarity. 
                                        One subjective knowledge question and four objective questions were used to measure students' understanding of nutrition. 
                                        Product Type was divided into snacks and staple foods, and Nutri Scores were divided between high and low scores.

                                        Respondents were sorted into two categories based on the Nutri Scores of the goods they tested. 
                                        Each group was then segmented based on product category (snacks and staple meals) and brand familiarity (familiar and unfamiliar).</P>

                                            <p>The mean perceived healthiness of snacks with high Nutri Scores is 2.279, indicating that respondents considered these snacks somewhat healthy. 
                                                The standard deviation of 1.654 shows a moderate range of responses around the mean. 
                                                The skewness of 1.027 indicates a positive skew, with more respondents rating their perceived healthiness lower than the mean. 
                                                The kurtosis of -0.177 suggests that the distribution has lighter tails than a normal distribution, 
                                                implying fewer extreme values in perceived healthiness ratings. 
                                            </p>
                                        <strong>Product Type: Staple Food</strong>
                                            <p>The mean perceived healthiness for staple foods with high Nutri Scores is 2.793, somewhat higher than for snacks, 
                                                showing that staple meals are considered healthier overall. The standard deviation of 2.034 implies that replies are more variable than usual. 
                                                The skewness of 0.707 suggests a less strong positive skew, while the kurtosis of -0.994 implies a distribution with lighter tails than usual, 
                                                comparable to the snacks category.

                                                demonstrating that brand familiarity dramatically improves perceived healthiness. 
                                                The standard deviation of 1.174 indicates reduced diversity in answers compared to unknown brands. 
                                                The skewness of -0.666 suggests a minor negative skew, with more respondents rating perceived healthiness higher. 
                                                The kurtosis of 0.548 indicates a reasonably flat distribution.

                                            This shows that brand familiarity influences perceptions of wellness. Staple foods are considered healthier than snacks in both high and low Nutri Score groups, 
                                            demonstrating a widespread preference for staple foods as healthier alternatives. Products with high Nutri Scores are seen as healthier than those with low Nutri Scores, 
                                            demonstrating Nutri Scores' effect on customer perceptions. Respondents with more nutrition knowledge tend to score the perceived healthiness of items higher, 
                                            implying that knowledgeable customers are more critical in their assessments.

                                                <p>The substantial positive correlation for brand familiarity (familiar) shows that consumers' perceptions of the healthfulness of goods with 
                                                    high Nutri Scores are much improved by brand familiarity. With a 95% confidence level of 1.96, the standard critical t-value is significantly 
                                                    exceeded by the t-value of 18.497, and the p-value is significantly below 0.05. 
                                                    Acceptance of H1 follows because brand familiarity raises perceptions of the healthfulness of goods with high Nutri Scores.

                                                    Thus, we disagree with H2: Brand familiarity lessens the detrimental effects of low Nutri-Scores.

                                                <p>According to the model summary, the model using the Nutri Score, nutrition knowledge, and brand familiarity 
                                                    (both known and unfamiliar) has an R2 of 0.608, an adjusted R2 of 0.602, and an RMSE of 0.864.

                                            <strong>ANOVA</strong>
                                                <p>According to the ANOVA findings, the model is statistically significant (F = 103.565, p < 0.001).</p>
                                            <strong>Coefficients</strong>
                                                <p>Brand familiarity (familiar) has a significant coefficient (0.689, p < 0.001).
                                                    Additionally notable is the coefficient for dietary knowledge (0.202, p < 0.001).
                                                    Although the considerable positive coefficient for nutrition knowledge indicates that perceived healthiness rises with increasing nutrition knowledge, 
                                                    the interaction between brand familiarity and nutrition knowledge is left out.

                                            <strong>Hypothesis 4 Conclusion</strong>
                                                <p>Both brand familiarity (familiar) and nutrition knowledge (significant coefficients, both p < 0.001) show that both favorably influence perceived healthiness. 
                                                    Nevertheless, we cannot conclude that increased nutrition knowledge lessens the impact of brand familiarity due to the absence of an interaction term. 
                                                    As a result, we reject H4: Brand familiarity has less of an impact when one is more knowledgeable about nutrition.

                                            this score indicates adequate internal consistency. 
                                            As a result, the study's measuring tools are trustworthy for assessing product categories, perceived healthfulness, nutrition awareness, and brand familiarity.

                                    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                                        <p>In summary, the perceived healthiness of items with different Nutri Scores was investigated in this research, along with the effects of product type, 
                                            brand familiarity, and nutrition knowledge. The findings showed that although increased nutrition knowledge positively improves perceived healthiness, 
                                            brand familiarity considerably increases the perceived healthiness of goods with high Nutri Scores. Higher nutrition knowledge has no 
                                            discernible effect on the influence of brand familiarity, and the impact of brand familiarity on Nutri-Score 
                                            perception is not substantially different depending on the kind of product. The results underline the significance of brand familiarity in 
                                            influencing consumers' views of healthiness and the need for companies to continue enjoying high brand recognition, particularly regarding health-related items. 
                                            The robustness of these results is further supported by the validity of the scales used in the investigation.

                                    <p>	The mean score for y1 is 11.39 with a standard deviation of 4.08. Given the non-normal shape and heavy skewness, 
                                        and the possible existence of outliers, there was much variation in Year 1 scores, 
                                        thereby suggesting that there are probably underlying causes for different levels of academic 
                                        self-confidence among students that would be worth further investigation.

                                    <p>The null hypothesis of the ANOVA comparing the Year 1 scores for the two groups is: 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        H0: The difference in academic self-confidence—Year 1 scores between the two groups is zero: Classroom 1 = Classroom 2.

                                        F-Statistic: 𝐹 = 𝑀𝑆𝐵 / 𝑀𝑆𝑊 = 62.66 / 15.81 ≈ 3.96 <br>
                                        Alpha Value: We use a common alpha level of 0.05.
                                    </P>
                                <h5>Findings Conclusion</h5>
                                    <p>In view of an F-statistic of 3.96 and a p-value of 0.0513, we fail to reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 level. 
                                        Thus, there is not enough evidence to conclude a significant difference in academic self-confidence between the two groups.
                                    </p>

                                    <h6>Assumptions</h6>
                                        <p>The p-value of the test for homogeneity of variances is very close to 0.05, 
                                            so we should be cautious about the assumption of equal variances. 
                                            The non-normality of data at least partly touches on the robustness of these results.

                                        <p>As with the hand calculation, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, which means that there is no statistically

                                        <strong>Explanation</strong>
                                            <p>The results from the manual and the software are consistent. They yield an F-statistic of 3.96 and a p-value of 0.0513. 
                                                This assures us that our manual calculations are correct, and at the same time, the software correctly performs the ANOVA computation.
                                                <br>
                                                From the ANOVA results, there is no difference in academic self-confidence between Classroom 1 and Classroom 2, 
                                                since the p-value is slightly above the 0.05 level of significance.

                                            <strong>Findings Recommendations and Conclusions</strong>
                                                <p>Results from ANOVA will determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between the two 
                                                    classrooms in academic self-confidence, as measured by the Year 1 scores. Given the nonsignificant result, the two classrooms would appear 
                                                    to perform similarly on this measure. Given the skewness of the data and presence of outliers, 
                                                    the principal might consider other factors by which further changes might be affected to improve academic self-confidence.

                                                    So, the principal's judgment may be right, but further measures could be explored to justify student development.

                                    <p>The question on differences in academic self-confidence is very instrumental since it helps the 
                                        principal understand classroom-level influences on students' confidence. 
                                        However, other factors like teacher differences, students' background, and classroom dynamics might impact these results.

                                <h5>Recommendation</h5>
                                    <p>	Further Data Collection: Other variables, such as teaching methods or parental involvement, should be collected to enrich the analysis. <br>
                                        	Consider Longitudinal Analysis: Tracking confidence over time might reveal patterns missed in a single-year analysis. <br>
                                        	Interventions: Focus on confidence-building strategies in all classrooms as there was no great difference between them.

                                    <h6>Conclusion</h6>
                                        <p>The positive regression coefficient (0.424) means that for each one-unit increase in SES, math scores go up by 0.424 points. 
                                            It can be said that SES has a moderate positive effect on math performance.
                                        </p>
                                    <h6>Recommendations</h6>
                                        <p>This sample probably would benefit from strategies that are going to support lower SES students for 
                                            improving math scores because SES is one of the strong predictors of math performance.

                                    <p>Directional Hypothesis (Private > Public): A directional hypothesis does not change the outcome since the 
                                        p-value is still greater than 0.05, indicating no significant difference in favor of private schools.

                                <h5>Conclusion and Recommendations</h5>
                                    <p> There is no significant difference in math scores between students from public and private schools. 
                                        It would, therefore, be more actionable to create individual student-focused 
                                        interventions across both types of schools rather than relying solely on school type as a predictor.
